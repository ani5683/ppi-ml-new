It includes high-resolution protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) complexes with detailed disorder annotations derived from the DisProt database and AlphaFold-based structure predictions. Each complex is filtered to ensure structural quality and biological relevance, with emphasis on disordered regions that participate in functional interfaces. This dataset supports downstream tasks such as binding affinity estimation and interaction prediction, and is ideal for assessing the capabilities of structure prediction models on biologically challenging cases involving intrinsic disorder."}
